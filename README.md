# cindRellaExample
This repository contains example code to demonstrating our method for fitting a Bayesian hierarchical model to evaluating the rarity of accidental configurations in footwear evidence.

cindRella contains the code necessary to build our R package for evaluating footwear evidence. It also contains synthetic data to demonstrate its use.

master_script.R contains snippets to fit our model and competitor models to synethic data contained in the cindRella package. It sources the R scripts data_prep.R, data_run.R, data_evaluate.R, and data_plot.R to
create plots that demonstrate fitting our model, competitor models, and variants to synthetic data
and evaluating it on additional held out synthetic data.

The tar.gz file contains the necessary source package for cindRella.
