# cindRellaExample
Small example code for demonstrating our Bayesian hierarchical model for evaluating the rarity of accidentals in footwear evidence.

cindRella contains the code necessary to build an R package for evaluating footwear evidence.
master_script.R can be used to run a small example to inspect some results. It sources the
other R scripts (data_prep.R, data_run.R, data_evaluate.R, and data_plot.R) to
create plots that demonstrate fitting our model, competitor models, and variants to synthetic data
and evaluating it on additional held out synthetic data.
