# cindRellaExample
Small example code for demonstrating our Bayesian hierarchical model for evaluating the rarity of accidentals in footwear evidence.

cindRella contains the code necessary to build an R package for evaluating footwear evidence,
and master_script.R can be used to run a small example to observe the results.
